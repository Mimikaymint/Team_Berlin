Problem description


Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for 
h1n1_vaccine
 and one for 
seasonal_vaccine
.


Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.

Labels




For this competition, there are two target variables:




h1n1_vaccine
 - Whether respondent received H1N1 flu vaccine.


seasonal_vaccine
 - Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine.




Both are binary variables: 
0
 = No; 
1
 = Yes. Some respondents didn't get either vaccine, others got only one, and some got both. This is formulated as a multilabel (and 
not
 multiclass) problem.




The features in this dataset




You are provided a dataset with 36 columns. The first column

Performance metric




Performance will be evaluated according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) for each of the two target variables. The mean of these two scores will be the overall score. A higher value indicates stronger performance.


In Python, you can calculate this using 
sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score
 for this multilabel setup with the default 
average="macro"
 parameter.




Submission format




The format for the submission file is three columns: 
respondent_id
, 
h1n1_vaccine
, and 
seasonal_vaccine
. The predictions for the two target variables should be 
float probabilities
 that range between 
0.0
 and 
1.0
. Because the competition uses ROC AUC as its evaluation metric, the values you submit must be the probabilities that a person received each vaccine, 
not
 binary labels.


As this is a multilabel problem, the probabilities for each row do 
not
 need to sum to one.


For example, if you predicted...












h1n1_vaccine


seasonal_vaccine






respondent_id














26707

26708

26710

26711


0.5

The first several lines of the 
.csv
 file that you submit would look like:


respondent_id,h1n1_vaccine,seasonal_vaccine
26707,0.5,0.7
26708,0.5,0.7
26709,0.5,0.7

Selection of winners


This Competition is a challenge of skill and the final results are determined by evaluating a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors, as more fully described on the Competition Website. For that portion of the Competition evaluated quantitatively, the results will be determined solely by leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard based on an objective statistical evaluation metric published on the Competition Website prior to commencement of the Competition  (subject to compliance with these Competition Rules). Participants' scores and ranks on the Competition Website at any given stage of the Competition will be based on the objective statistical evaluation metric described on the Competition Website, as determined by applying the predictions in the Submission to the ground truth of a validation dataset whose instances were a fixed set sampled from the Data. For that portion of the Competition evaluated qualitatively, the results will be determined by a panel of judges, as more fully described on the Competition Website. As more fully described on the Competition Website, the Competition may have a quantitative winner, a qualitative winner, a combined quantitative and qualitative winner, or all three.


The evaluation metric used for scoring and ranking Submissions will be displayed on the Competition Website.


Any prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Competition Rules. All decisions of DrivenData, the Competition Sponsor and/or judges will be final and binding on all matters relating to this Competition. DrivenData reserves the right to examine the Submission and any associated code or documentation for compliance with these Competition Rules. In the event that the Submission demonstrates a breach of these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor or DrivenData may at its discretion take either of the following actions:




disqualify your Submission(s); or 


require that you remediate within one week all issues identified in your Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).




A tie between two or more valid and identically ranked submissions will be resolved in favor of the tied submission that was submitted first.


A Participant may decline to be nominated as a Winner by notifying DrivenData directly within one week following the Competition deadline, in which case the declining Participant forgoes any prize or other features associated with winning the Competition. DrivenData reserves the right to disqualify a Participant who so declines at DrivenData's sole discretion if DrivenData deems disqualification appropriate.


Prizes and conditions


If the Competition has a  prize, the Prize Winner(s) will be notified and announced within 30 days of the end of the Competition on the Competition Website.


The Prize Winner(s) will receive their prizes awarded as a check or electronic transfer from DrivenData. 


If a Team wins a prize, all Team members must submit a single written statement describing how the prize is to be allocated among the Team members. If the Team fails to submit such statement within 30 days after DrivenData requests it, then DrivenData will distribute the prize among Team members in equal shares and will have no further obligation to winning Team members.


As a condition of receipt of the prize, winner must deliver the algorithm's code and documentation to DrivenData. The source code must contain a description of resources required to build and run the algorithm. The accompanying documentation should be consistent with DrivenData's 
Winning Model Documentation Template
, which will be provided to winners within 30 days of the end of the Competition Period.


The prize may be awarded to an alternate winner if required documentation is not returned within thirty (30) days after mailing to winner, if prize notification letter/email or prize is returned as undeliverable, if winner does not respond to an email or other communication from DrivenData within ten (10) days of the date sent, or if the winner, in DrivenDataâs judgment, does not respond to reasonable requests for information related to prize delivery or otherwise unable or unwilling to coordinate prize delivery within thirty (30) days after prize notification. Allow thirty (30) days for prize delivery. By accepting any prize/award, Winner agrees to allow DrivenData and/or the Competition Sponsor to disclose Winnerâs first name, first initial of last name, and city of residence, as well as prize information to the extent required by law, and if so required by law, Winner agrees to the disclosure of additional personal information, all without additional compensation. 


DrivenData is responsible only for prize delivery and is not responsible for prize utility or otherwise. No substitution or transfer of prizes is permitted. All taxes, fees and expenses associated with participation in the Competition or receipt and use of a prize are the sole responsibility of the Prize Winner(s).


PARTICIPANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING.

As a further condition of receipt of a Prize, each winning Participant thereby licenses their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission according to the Winner License Type specified above (note: if no Winner License Type is specified above, the Winner License Type is deemed to be Non-Exclusive License).


NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE.

If the Winner License Type for the Competition (see Winner License Type above) is a Non-Exclusive License then each Winner by accepting a Prize thereby:




grants to Competition Sponsor and its designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, not use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission, in any media now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without further approval by or payment to Participant; and

Allow 30 days from final confirmation for Prize delivery. Any winners who are U.S. citizens will receive an IRS 1099 form in the amount of their prize at the appropriate time. Prize winners are responsible for any taxes, fees or other liability resulting from their receipt of a Prize.


Permissions


Except where prohibited by law, entry constitutes permission to use winners' names, hometowns and likenesses for online posting, and/or any advertising and publicity without additional compensation. Winners may also be required to sign and return a release of liability, declaration of eligibility and, where lawful, a publicity consent agreement, as conditions of receiving a prize. Failure to comply with the aforementioned conditions shall be grounds for forfeiture of a prize.


Data use and code sharing


DATA.

"Data" means the Data or Datasets linked from the Competition Website for the purpose of use by Participants in the Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, Data is deemed for the purpose of these Competition Rules to include any prototype or executable code provided to Participants by DrivenData or via the Competition Website. Participants must use the Data only as permitted by these Competition Rules and any associated data use rules specified on the Competition Website.


Unless otherwise permitted by the terms of the Competition Website, Participants must use the Data solely for the purpose and duration of the Competition, including but not limited to reading and learning from the Data, analyzing the Data, modifying the Data and generally preparing your Submission and any underlying models and participating in forum discussions on the Competition Website. Participants agree to use suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Competition Rules from gaining access to the Data and agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Data to any party not participating in the Competition. Participants agree to notify DrivenData immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission or unauthorized access of the Data and agree to work with DrivenData to rectify any unauthorized transmission. Participants agree that participation in the Competition shall not be construed as having or being granted a license (expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) under, or any right of ownership in, any of the Data.


EXTERNAL DATA.

Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Competition Website, Participants must not use data other than the Data to develop and test their models and Submissions. Competition Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any Participant who Competition Sponsor discovers has undertaken or attempted to undertake the use of data other than the Data, or who uses the Data other than as permitted according to the Competition Website and in these Competition Rules, in the course of the Competition.


CODE SHARING.

Participants are prohibited from privately sharing source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, and any such sharing is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.
Participants are permitted to publicly share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, or otherwise relevant to the Competition, provided that such sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. By so sharing, the sharing Participant is thereby deemed to have licensed the shared code under the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at 
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
).


OPEN-SOURCE CODE.

A Submission will be ineligible to win a prize if it was developed using code containing or depending on software licensed under an open source license:




other than an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see
